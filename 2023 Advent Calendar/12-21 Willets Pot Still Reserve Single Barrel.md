👃: Honey, Maple, Dried Hay, Clove, Nutmeg Vanilla

👅: Herbal Tea, Spearmint, Licorice, Black Pepper, Maple Syrup, Oak, Citrus, Copper

🏁: Sweet and spicy, almost medicinal.  Short.  Dry.  Starts out with a hint of herbal tea but quickly becomes an overwhelming swirl of spice and oak.  Pretty underwhelming.

Reminiscent of the [[12-18 Rowans Creek Small Batch]].  Less of the offensive taste of sweet tea.  Less spiced, but still definitely not for me.  Take that dirty leaf water elsewhere.  Adding a touch of water made it more palatable.  Full pass.
