👃: Cherry, Oak, Marzipan, Chocolate, Herbs

👅: Oak, Cherry, Orange Bitters, Dark Chocolate, Mint

🏁: Short dry, medicinal and smokey.

This is not entirely unlike drinking an equivalent amount of dayquil.  Sweetness doesn't quite cover up a very bitter flavor and the aftertaste is very medicinal and unwelcome in my opinion, but doesn't stick around too long.  The glass mellows as it rests and becomes a little more palatable.  A few drops of water liven it up a bit too, bringing out more nuttiness and lightening the bitter aftertaste.  I think this is just not one for me.  YMMV.

2024:  Revisited this one in early 2024 and found it more palatable.  Going to chock my initial revulsion up to drinking it directly after eating KBBQ.
