👅: Oak, honey, citrus, smoke, molasses, cinnamon

This is a very good bourbon.  
Might be my second favorite of the bunch so far.  
This bottle has a MSRP of \$65, but is regularly sold between \$150 - \$200 around me.  
The lowest price I've seen on Drizly is $120.  
At $120 this bottle gets downgraded from great to okay, but if you can find it somewhere for under $80, it's a no brainer.
