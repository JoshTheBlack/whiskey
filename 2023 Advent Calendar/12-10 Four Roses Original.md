👃: Cherry, Oak, and Dusty Corn at first. After a short rest, Cinnamon, Vanilla Cream, Orange, and Honey.

🏁: Short, not a lot of burn, slightly bitter and acidic at first fading into oak and spices.

Weighing in at 80 proof, this is at the lowest end for Bourbon ABV.  Usually around $20 a bottle in my area.  This is one of my go to mixers actually, courtesy of Dennis' recommendation.  I used it in my ⁠AB's Aged Eggnog batch 2023 back in May and have been enjoying that eggnog since Black Friday.  It is delicately scented and flavored, a little watered down really, but fairly inoffensive as far as bourbon's go.  Not the best sipper, but a great all around option for mixing drinks, or a nice coffee additive.  If you want a better option from this distillery, their Single Barrel at 50% ABV is a solid option at around $50.
