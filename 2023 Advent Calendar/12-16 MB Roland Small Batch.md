👃: Moonshine, Sweet Corn, Apple, Cinnamon, Oak

👅: Moonshine, Toffee, Clove, Oak

🏁: Short finish.  Warm in the throat, buttery in the mouth with the lingering taste of raw corn and a slight medicinal taste.

This is what I imagine you would get if you brewed up and distilled some decent moonshine and left it in a charred oak barrel for a year or two, only with a little rye.  Very potent.  At first I was a little put off by both the smell and taste because I wasn't expecting that characteristic taste of high octane moonshine.  It grew on me as I sipped it and my expectations adjusted.  I don't think I would buy this, it's just not what I'm looking for in a bourbon.
