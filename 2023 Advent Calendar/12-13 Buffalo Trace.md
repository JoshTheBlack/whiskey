👃: Cherry, Vanilla, Strawberry, Dry Grass, Brown Sugar, Oak

👅: Very mellow and thin mouth feel.  Citrus, bitter cherry, mild oak.

🏁: The finish is long and mellow, slightly bitter up front fading into more citrus with whisps of oak. Not super complex, but very enjoyable.  

This is similarly priced with [[12-02 Elijah Craig Small Batch]] from Day 2.  For my money, I'd grab that for the complexity and extra abv.
