Sweet and mellow scent, oak, butterscotch and spice. 

Lots of rye, pepper, and oak. 

A little honey and a hint of apple on the tongue. 

A little sour and bright with a medium finish. 

It's very good for such a young craft rye. 

The price (~$90/750ml) is a little steep, but if you like rye, this gets a rec from me.
