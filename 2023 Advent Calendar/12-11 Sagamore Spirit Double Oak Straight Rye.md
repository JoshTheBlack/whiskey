👃: Orange, Honey, Petrichor, Maple Syrup, Rye, Mint

👅: Peppery Rye, Toasted Nuts (Hazelnut and Pecan mostly), Brown Sugar, Vanilla, Malt, Charred Oak, Citrus

🏁: Long finish, slightly acidic with a lot of oakiness.

This has an oily mouth feel that coats the taste buds quickly leaving behind a strong characteristic peppery rye burning sensation that slowly fades into dark roast Ethiopian coffee.  Sour and bitter.  It lingers on the back of the tongue, right where you make the "g" sound in "that's a Great Glass of bourbon."  It's very pleasant.  This is about $75 in my area, and in my opinion is worth every cent.  This is my new favorite of the 11 so far.
