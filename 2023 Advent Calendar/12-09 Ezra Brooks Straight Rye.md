Not great Bob!  

It is entirely unfair to this bourbon that I started sampling it 10 minutes after finishing the Blanton's, so let me just say it's a decent rye to keep on hand for mixing or sipping  once you hit the point that the flavor is less important.  This is pretty good in its price range of around $15.  Absolutely nothing special apart from the value per dollar ratio being high.
