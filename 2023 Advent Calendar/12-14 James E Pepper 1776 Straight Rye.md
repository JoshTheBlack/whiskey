👃: Strong Oak, Floral Perfume, White Pepper, Rye, Lemon, Clove, Mint

👅: Pepper, Lemon, Oak, Pine, Floral tea, Vanilla, Chocolate, Honey, Butter

🏁: Medium, Lemon and Oak fade into bitter chocolate pepper and mint.  Soft and oily feel.

Not bad for a very spicy rye if you like that strong white pepper burn.  Not very complex, maybe a little too bitter for my taste.  This is around $35, and for my money certainly not as good as [[12-05 Sazerac Straight Rye]] in the same price category.
