👃: Maple, Caramel, Apricot, Charred Oak, Spicy Rye

👅: Rye, Tobacco, Oak, Vanilla, Honey, Lemon

🏁: Very long finish.  Lots of spicy rye on the front end that fades into grain and burnt toffee followed by a very bitter lemon accented by smoke and leather.

Excellent and spicy.  Much spicier than the Blanton's Single Barrel from day 8.  Adding a splash of water actually brought this down in my opinion, but mellowed out the finish in a nice way.  

At the MSRP of `$120`, I might consider it.  Being that this is normally found north of `$200`, and sometimes north of `$400` (seriously, drizly shows the only two stores in my area with it listed at `$500` and `$920`) this is just absurd.
