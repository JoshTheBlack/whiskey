Considering this is a gimmick whiskey blend, it's actually a pretty good sip for around $40 a bottle.  So this started as a team up between a bourbon legend (Dave Pickerell of Maker's Mark and Whistle Pig) and Metallica.  They blend American Bourbon and American Rye, and age it in black brandy casks while playing Metallica into them.  The claim is it measurably releases flavor compounds from the barrels into the blend.  While this is entirely drinkable, and really a pretty decent option at it's price I don't think I'll be adding it to my shelf.  If you want a kind of half rye, this is for you.
