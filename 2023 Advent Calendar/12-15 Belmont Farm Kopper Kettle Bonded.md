👃: Dark Chocolate, Damp Wood, Apple, Cinnamon, Oak, Pepper, Nutmeg

👅: Pepper, Smoke, Tobacco, Hazelnut, Brown Sugar

🏁: Very short finish. Pepper and dark chocolate mostly obscured by char and a lingering hint of nuttiness.

I actually like this despite it's lack of complexity.  It is very char/smoke forward and pretty bitter as far as bourbons go.  A little alcohol burn.  This is not available in my area at all.  Oddly enough, the cheapest online retailer I can find is thespiritco.com in England, where this advent calendar came from.  There it goes for around $60 USD.  Elsewhere it's double or more.  If you have the opportunity, give it a try.  Don't spend $150 for a bottle though.  Or do.  You are the master of your own finances.
