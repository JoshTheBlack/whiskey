👃: Dates, Toffee, Oak, Peppery Rye, Old Books, Damp Wood

👅: Cherry, Licorice Chocolate, Honey, Cinnamon, Vanilla Cream, Mint

🏁: Long finish.  Sweet licorice and spicy pepper up front fading into vanilla, tart cherries, and maple syrup.

This is a go to mixer for lots of people.  It's not a bad sipper either in it's price range.  (~$30)  This will probably be my go to rye under $50 now.  I definitely enjoyed it more than the similarly priced Sazerac, though it doesn't hold a candle to the more expensive Rye's in this calendar, Kentucky Peerless ($90) and Sagamore Spirit Double Oak ($75, my favorite of the calendar so far).
