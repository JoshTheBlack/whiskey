👃: Dates, Toffee, Oak, Peppery Rye, Old Books, Damp Wood

👅: Cherry, Licorice Chocolate, Honey, Cinnamon, Vanilla Cream, Mint

🏁: Long finish.  Sweet licorice and spicy pepper up front fading into vanilla, tart cherries, and maple syrup.

This is a go to mixer for lots of people.  It's not a bad sipper either in it's price range.  `(~$30)`  This will probably be my go to rye under `$50` now.  I definitely enjoyed it more than the similarly priced [[12-05 Sazerac Straight Rye]], though it doesn't hold a candle to the more expensive Rye's in this calendar, [[12-03 Kentucky Peerless Small Batch]] `($90)` and [[12-11 Sagamore Spirit Double Oak Straight Rye]] (`$75`, my favorite of the calendar so far).
