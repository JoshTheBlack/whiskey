👃 Oak, citrus, leather, tobacco, grape

👅 Charred oak, citrus, barley, cherry, coffee, cinnamon, chocolate, nutmeg, clove

🏁 Long finish, starting sweet and turning sour leaving behind dark chocolate fading slowly into smoke

💧 A splash of water brings out fig, hazelnut, and chewy caramel candy and cuts the sourness and spice a bit.

This is all around great if you like scotch.  Great feel in the mouth, with a tail that leaves my mouth watering.  I'd like to see what this is like aged 10 years or more.

Definitely recommend.
