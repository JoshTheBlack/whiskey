It smells like warm fall spices, pancakes and maple syrup, caramel cream, graham cracker.  Maybe a hint of banana.

Sweet caramel candy, cinnamon and mild oak flavors. A hint of tobacco too.  Very smooth in the mouth.

Short finish with trailing syrup flavor.

It doesn't do much to stand out, but at $35 it's a perfectly cromulent option for mixing, or sipping if you like sweet whiskey at the minimum proof allowed.  Probably a good one for the person whose favorite whiskey is JD.

Interestingly, this is produced in Columbia TN, with corn grown within 50 miles of the distillery.

Has a great looking bottle too.
