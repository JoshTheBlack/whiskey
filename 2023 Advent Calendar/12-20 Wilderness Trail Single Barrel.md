👃: Warm Spices, Apple, Peach, Root Beer

👅: Candied Apple, Butterscotch, Root Beer, Anise Seed, Strong White Pepper

🏁: Long finish, with spiced apple pie, oak, and anise accentuated by some of that root beer bite.

Quite good and very unique.  The single barrel is not available near me at all, but the small batch is for around $60.  I might need to pick up a bottle to see how it compares.  The nose is top tier.  The palate is good.  The finish is a little underwhelming in comparison.  I would definitely buy it though.  I think this calendar has taught me that I like Rye's a lot more than I believed going into it.
