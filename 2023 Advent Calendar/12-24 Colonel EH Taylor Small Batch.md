👃: Cherry Candy, Oak, Vanilla, Cinnamon, Raisins, Black Pepper

👅: Pepper, Vanilla, Brown Sugar, Mint, Raisins, Charred Oak, Citrus

🏁: Medium peppery finish with hints of tobacco and peppermint

Top shelf.  This is one of the best of the Buffalo Trace distillery offerings in this calendar.  Swishing for a few seconds brings out a lot more woody notes and stretches the peppermint finish a lot.  At the `$40` MSRP, this is an absolute steal.  Most places around here that have it are listing it at around `$180`, though I do see it listed at one place for $88.  I'd consider it at that price.
