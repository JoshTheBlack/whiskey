Smells of cherry, vanilla, oak, leather, and mentol with a hint of clove.

Sweet, spice, and citrus at first gives way to caramel, spice and fruit.

Thin and spicy feel in the mouth.

Medium finish with lingering oak and pepper.

At $30, its a good value.  Decent enough.  You've probably had Sazerac before, so who I am trying to convince.

Decent in it's price range of Rye's.
