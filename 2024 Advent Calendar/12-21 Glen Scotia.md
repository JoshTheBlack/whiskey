# Glen Scotia
## Double Cask Single Malt Scotch Whisky
#### 46% ABV
üëÅ: A deep, tawny gold, verging on the rich, dark hues of polished mahogany. The whisky forms medium-thick legs that descend with the slow, deliberate drip of molasses, hinting at a substantial body.

üëÉ: The nose is greeted with a unique and intriguing blend of aromas. The sweetness of Nutella-covered bananas is the first to emerge, followed by an unexpected hint of curry spices, adding an exotic twist. A briny note, reminiscent of sea air and the comforting scents of maple syrup, almond, and oak provide a grounding presence.

üëÖ: The whisky presents a dry and astringent mouthfeel that immediately commands attention. Flavors of cherries and raisins emerge, intertwined with the familiar warmth of oak and a spark of chili pepper heat. The sweetness of maple syrup returns, accompanied by the comforting spice of nutmeg and the nutty aroma of almond. A touch of worn leather adds a layer of complexity, while a wisp of smoke provides a subtle, intriguing undertone.

üèÅ: A short and sweet finish leaves a fleeting impression. Oak and a medley of spices linger briefly, accompanied by a touch of citric acidity and a hint of sherry. A chili pepper burn provides a brief warmth that fades quickly, leaving a somewhat abrupt conclusion.

This single malt offers a somewhat middling experience, a whisky that's neither exceptional nor disappointing. While the nose presents an intriguing array of aromas, the palate and finish don't quite reach the same heights of complexity. At `$69`, it faces stiff competition. The [[12-07 Craigellachie]], with its infinitely more complex profile, offers a better value at a lower price. For just $20 more, the [[12-04 Lagavulin]] delivers a far more memorable and satisfying experience. And the [[12-17 Bruichladdich]], at a similar price point, provides a more well-rounded and ultimately more rewarding journey for the palate. While this dram is not a bad choice, it simply doesn't "wow" in the same way as these other options, making it a less compelling choice in a crowded market.
