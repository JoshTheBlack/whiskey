## 13 Year Old Bas-Armagnac Cask Finish Single Malt Scotch Whisky
#### 46% ABV

👁: A vibrant yellow-gold, almost reminiscent of a freshly poured glass of apple juice. Thin legs race down the glass, hinting at a lighter body.

👃: This one's a journey! Imagine stepping into a mechanic's workshop, with the distinct aroma of engine oil, dirty rubber, and musty old rags hanging in the air. Next door, toasted pine nuts offer a welcome respite, followed by a curious gamey note, like a whiff of moose or elk hanging in a hunting lodge. As the whiskey opens up, it reveals buttery biscuits, ancient chocolate, and the faintest whisper of sulfur. Finally, a touch of sweetness emerges with honey and pickled pineapple. 

👅: The initial sip explodes with a strong almost iron-like mineral character. A veil of smoke and a refreshing sourness weave through the metallic notes. Warm baking spices abound – clove, cinnamon, and allspice – with a hint of hazelnut adding a nutty richness. A touch of sulfur lingers from the nose. A splash of water works wonders, taming the gamey notes and coaxing out tropical fruit and crisp apple, while amping up the overall sourness. The mouthfeel is pleasantly medium-thin.

🏁: A medium-long finish that leaves a lingering impression. It's a touch dirty and funky, with hazelnut and sulfur playing hide-and-seek amidst a wave of pepper and spice. A mild sourness has the final say, punctuated by hints of bitter orange.

This is a truly complex pour that keeps you on your toes. Aromas and flavors jostle for attention, creating a captivating sensory experience. Interestingly, the official tasting notes mention "cordite." While my recent trip to the shooting range might have primed my senses, I definitely picked up on those gunpowder nuances, interpreting them as iron and game. Adding a splash of water truly unlocks this whiskey's potential, revealing hidden depths.
For `$53`, this bottle offers exceptional value. While it may not be my typical dram of choice, I thoroughly enjoyed exploring its intricacies.
