## 18 Year Old Viking Pride Single Malt Scotch Whisky
#### 43% ABV
üëÅÔ∏è: A beautiful light gold, reminiscent of a summer sunrise, with a subtle hint of amber adding depth and warmth. The whisky forms medium, slow-moving legs that cling to the glass, suggesting a balanced texture.

üëÉ: The nose is greeted with a fascinating interplay of aromas. An initial burst of black pepper and mint gives way to the sweetness of cane syrup, like a Southern summer breeze. A delicate wisp of light smoke, followed by the comforting warmth of cinnamon and the grounding presence of oak. A subtle undercurrent of peat provides an earthy foundation. The aroma of grilled peaches, caramelized and juicy, mingles with the sweetness of raisins, creating a complex and inviting bouquet.

üëÖ: The palate is enveloped in a wave of honey, followed by a delightful medley of orchard fruits ‚Äì crisp apple and succulent peach. A note of sweetened light roast coffee adds a layer of sophisticated bitterness, while a gentle touch of peat smoke provides a subtle, smoky undertone.

üèÅ: The finish is a long, lingering experience, characterized by a velvety, chocolatey texture that coats the mouth. The subtle smoke persists in the background, allowing the sweetness to shine through. A touch of spicy ginger provides a gentle warmth, the only real sign of heat in this otherwise mellow dram. The finish gradually fades into a slightly salty, sour memory, a unique and intriguing conclusion.

This single malt is a study in complexity and subtlety, a whisky that reveals its charms gradually, much like the [[12-12 Glenfarclas]] and [[12-02 Hibiki Suntory Whisky]]. While it may not reach the same heights of excellence and refinement as Glenfarlcas, it shares the nuanced character and delicate balance, and in my opinion outshines the Hibiki Suntory. Its gentle smokiness makes it a potential gateway into the world of peated whiskies, a good starting point for those new to this style. However, the `$180` price tag does raise questions about its value proposition. While it's a delightful and complex dram, it might not offer enough intensity or uniqueness to justify the cost for seasoned whisky enthusiasts. It's a whisky to be contemplated and appreciated for its subtle charms, but perhaps one that's best savored as a special occasion treat rather than a regular indulgence.
