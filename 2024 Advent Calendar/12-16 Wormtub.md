## 12 Year Old Speyside Single Malt Scotch Whisky
#### 55.2% ABV
👁: A captivating deep golden brown, reminiscent of aged cognac, with flashes of copper that catch the light like hidden treasures. The whisky moves quickly in the glass, leaving behind thin, quick legs that suggest a lighter body than its color might imply.

👃: The nose is greeted with a rich and inviting aroma of brown sugar, its caramelized sweetness mingling with the bright, tangy scent of orange marmalade. A distinct sherry influence adds depth and complexity, while a grounding note of aged oak provides a solid foundation. A ghost of aged cotton lingers in the air, a spectral reminder of attics past, where cotton batting held the warmth of a generation. The scent of pecan pie, with its buttery crust and sweet filling, completes this delightful olfactory experience.

👅: The whisky coats the mouth with an oily, luxurious texture. An immediate heat from chili pepper ignites the palate, followed by the unique numbing sensation of Szechuan peppercorns, a fascinating and unexpected twist. Notes of malt and oak provide a familiar grounding, while the flavors of black cherry and salted caramel add a layer of sweet complexity.

🏁 **Finish:** A remarkably long finish unfolds, a testament to the whisky's intensity. The heat, likely amplified by the high ABV, lingers on the palate. Lots of malt and the spicy warmth of sherry influence dominate the lingering flavors, accompanied by that distinctive numbing Szechuan heat that continues to tingle on the tongue.

This dram is undoubtedly the highest ABV offering in the calendar so far, a whisky that commands attention with its bold flavors and lingering heat. The unique numbing sensation from the Szechuan peppercorns is a particularly memorable element, one that elevates the tasting experience and sets it apart. It's a whisky that's both intriguing and delicious, a testament to skill. It's a shame that details about this particular expression, especially at this specific ABV, are unavailable. The lack of information about its cost and availability is indeed unfortunate, as this is a dram that many whisky enthusiasts would likely appreciate. It's a tantalizing glimpse into a world of flavor that, sadly, might remain out of reach.
