# The Hakushu
## Distiller's Reserve Single Malt Japanese Whisky
#### 43% ABV
üëÅ: A deeply burnished copper, like the warm glow of a well-loved antique, with a rich, captivating hue. The whisky clings to the glass, forming long, thick legs that descend with a glacial slowness, hinting at a luxurious, full-bodied experience.

üëÉ: The nose is greeted with a vibrant medley of sweet and earthy notes. Crisp green apple and the golden sweetness of honey mingle with the comforting richness of caramel. The scent of cedar and birchwood adds a woody, aromatic dimension, while a note of dry hay and the musty aroma of old books evoke a sense of time-worn elegance. A faint wisp of tobacco smoke adds intrigue, but it's a specific kind, not the luxurious aroma of pipe tobacco, but rather the sharper, mentholated scent of a Marlboro cigarette. 

üëÖ: The palate is enveloped in a wave of creamy vanilla, immediately followed by a subtle yet distinct peat smoke that adds a layer of complexity. Rich chocolate and the warm spice of clove emerge, creating a harmonious balance. The green apple and caramel detected on the nose reappear, adding a touch of sweetness. Salted walnuts and a spark of black pepper provide a savory, spicy counterpoint. A more unusual, almost industrial adhesive note adds to the medley, while a grounding presence of oak rounds out the experience.

üèÅ: A long, lingering finish unfolds, leaving a lasting impression of sweetness and spice. Vanilla, cedar, and oak dominate the lingering flavors, creating a comforting warmth. A more refined, pleasant smokiness emerges, adding depth and complexity, while a faint hint of turpentine provides a final, unexpected twist.

This single malt offers a unique and intriguing experience, a whisky that balances delicate peat smoke with a medley of sweet, spicy, and woody notes. The very light peat smoke is a welcome addition, adding complexity without overwhelming the other flavors, making it a good option for those who don't enjoy heavily peated whiskies. The industrial funk, while unusual, adds a distinctive character that sets it apart. It's a dram that's certainly enjoyable and one that I'd happily revisit. However, the $220 price tag is a significant barrier, making it a difficult proposition when compared to other offerings in the market. While the quality is undeniable, the value simply isn't there at this price point. It's a whisky that deserves to be appreciated for its unique profile, but one that's likely out of reach for many.
