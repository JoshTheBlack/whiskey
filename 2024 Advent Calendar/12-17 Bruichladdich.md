## The Classic Laddie Single Malt Scotch Whisky
#### 50% ABV
üëÅ: An exceptionally pale gold, reminiscent of a crisp Sauvignon Blanc, with a delicate, almost ethereal hue. The whisky moves with a surprising lightness in the glass, forming thin, quick legs that race down the sides.

üëÉ: The nose is greeted with an intriguing mix of aromas. A sweet note of honey blends with an unexpected, almost industrial scent of blown tire. Beneath this, familiar notes of vanilla and lemon emerge, followed by a sharp, clean ethanol presence. A touch of aniseed adds an herbal complexity, while a whisper of malt and a hint of brine provide a subtle depth. A faint aroma of sawdust and a bright note of orange add further layers to this unusual bouquet. 

üëÖ: The whisky belies its light appearance with a surprisingly thick and oily mouthfeel that coats the palate. An eruption of hot white pepper provides a lively introduction that rolls into the classic bourbon flavors of oak, vanilla, and caramel. That curious rubber note from the nose reappears and a refreshing hint of mint emerges, followed by a subtle touch of salt and a whisper of char, like a well worn hoodie the morning after a bonfire. A reprise of anise adds a lingering herbal note. 

üèÅ: The finish is on the shorter side, a fleeting moment compared to the complexity of the nose and palate. A gentle earthiness and a delicate floral note provide a brief moment of calm before the ethanol makes its presence known, lingering with a warmth that outlasts the other flavors.

This single malt is a study in contrasts, a whisky that self-contradicts with its unusual combination of flavors and aromas. Priced at $55, it represents a solid value, offering a unique experience that's well worth exploring. While the relatively short finish might leave some wanting more, it's an otherwise well-crafted dram. You could certainly do worse at this price point, and for those who prefer their Scotch unpeated, this whisky is well worth the money. Its unconventional profile makes it a memorable and rewarding experience.
