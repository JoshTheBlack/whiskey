## 21 Year Old Single Malt Irish Whiskey
#### 40% ABV

👁: Copper with ruddy tones around the edges, verging on russet.  Medium thick prominent legs recede slowly hinting at rich and complex flavor. 

👃: Very honey-forward, with caramel and maple syrup.  Old leather and parchment, like a forgotten attic filled with antique books and faded photographs.  Vanilla and peat. Grassy. Dark chocolate with a hint of sherry.  Like Willy Wonka's office after he's just returned from the chocolate river.  Just a hint of aniseed or tarragon.

👅: Very bitter.  White pepper and cloves.  Strong mineral flavor, like graphite with a hint of sulfur.  Bitter grapefruit with dark brown sugar.  Viscous sherry wine with a hint of very old oak.

🏁: Rosewater perfume or potpourri.  Very floral.  Medium long finish filled with bitter mineral notes and a peppery rye.  Reminiscent of espresso beans.  

The nose is like a time capsule in a glass, capturing the essence of a bygone era.  One of the best I could imagine.  The palate leaves a little to be desired, and the finish while not unpleasant was very lacking.  This is really hurt by it's low octane, even more so than [[12-01 The Dalmore]] and [[12-02 Hibiki Suntory Whisky]].  For a bottle north of `$300`, this is a disappointment.  Or maybe I just have a peasants palate.
