# Loch Lomond
## 14 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky
#### 46% ABV
üëÅ: A rich, deep golden hue, just a shade darker than amber, like the warm glow of a late afternoon sun. The whisky clings to the glass with moderate, slow-moving legs, hinting at a luxurious texture.

üëÉ: The nose is greeted with a delightful combination of sweet and savory aromas. The richness of raisins and buttery pastry, like a freshly baked danish, intertwines with the comforting spice of chocolate, cinnamon, and a hint of pimento. A more unusual, musty note emerges, reminiscent of a damp garage or the earthy scent of damp wood, adding an intriguing layer of complexity. A crisp note of green apple provides a refreshing lift, while a subtle whisper of peat adds a touch of smokiness. 

üëÖ: The whisky coats the palate with a thick, velvety texture, a luxurious and satisfying sensation. A burst of sour lemon provides a lively counterpoint to the sweetness of the nose, followed by the warm spice of clove. The gentle peat smoke detected on the nose makes a more pronounced appearance, accompanied by a hint of vanilla. The crisp green apple returns, alongside a more vegetal, earthy note, akin to parsnip skin. A touch of white pepper adds a gentle heat. That funky, musty note from the nose reappears, adding an intriguing, almost mysterious element.

üèÅ: A medium-long finish unfolds, leaving a pleasant memory on the palate. The crisp green apple and warm clove spice linger, while the effervescence of the burn is reminiscent of seltzer water, a light and refreshing sensation. The peat smoke and a grounding note of oak provide a satisfying, lingering presence. 

This single malt delivers on its promise of "Spiced apple and soft smoke," offering a well-balanced and enjoyable experience. It's a whisky that's both comforting and intriguing, with its blend of sweet, spicy, and earthy notes. The online price of `$110`, including shipping, does seem a bit steep for what it offers. However, if found locally for `$60-$70`, it would represent a solid value and a worthwhile purchase. While it might not crack my top 5 of this years calendar for me, it's a dram that's clearly enjoyable and memorable in its own right. It's a testament to the whisky's quality that I'd happily pick it up at the right price.
