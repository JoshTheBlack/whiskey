## Single Malt Irish Whiskey
#### 40% ABV

👁: Ruddy copper.  Thin yet glacially slow legs.

👃: This whiskey throws a chaotic bouquet. It's a heady whirlwind of industrial fumes – think paint thinner and the oily tang of a mechanic's garage – crashing headlong into a county fair. You catch whiffs of green apple candy, cherry cotton candy sweetness, and the comforting aroma of freshly ground coffee beans. It's a wild ride, but ultimately a simple one, lacking the depth and nuance of a truly complex spirit.

👅: This whiskey hits the palate with an astringent bite, like a splash of witch hazel. Sour apple and pine sap wrestle for dominance, while a whisper of sherry tries to smooth things over. A flicker of white peppercorn adds a spicy prickle, then gives way to a fleeting impression of tart strawberry. It's very woody – dry pine needles and young white oak, with a lingering hint of cloves. It coats the mouth in a thick, oily embrace.

🏁: The finish fades quickly. Damp oak and sawdust linger, with a fleeting ghost of cherry sweetness struggling to emerge from the overwhelming dryness and lingering astringency. It departs with a whimper, not a bang.

In the end, this is exactly what it appears to be: a cheap blended scotch with a splash of Irish whiskey thrown in for good measure. And at `$27`, you're getting precisely what you pay for. The bottle itself is an eyesore, and the whiskey within, while not offensively bad, certainly won't be winning any awards. It's a perfectly acceptable choice for those on a tight budget, but don't expect anything remarkable.
