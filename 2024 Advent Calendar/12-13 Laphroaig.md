## 10 Year Old Sherry Oak Finish Single Malt Scotch Whisky
#### 48% ABV
**üëÅÔ∏è:** A deep, rich cherry oak, like the polished wood of a cherished antique, with a captivating reddish hue. The whisky clings to the glass with impressive tenacity, forming slow, thick legs that descend with a stately, viscous grace.

**üëÉ:** The nose is immediately enveloped in a powerful wave of campfire smoke, intense and ashen, with a distinct oaky character. A strong current of brine, like a gust of sea air on a windswept coast, adds a salty dimension. Beneath these dominant notes lie a complex and subtle blend of aromas: ripe cherry and plum, the earthy scent of dry hay, and the warm spice of cloves. A tantalizing note of crispy, burnt-end pork belly adds a savory, almost sulfuric complexity while dark chocolate and molasses add richness. A pervasive saltiness permeates the experience, yet a curious, almost rubbery note occasionally surfaces, adding an unexpected twist..

**üëÖ:** The palate is struck by a powerful combination of charcoal and chocolate, a bittersweet duet of char and ash. Heavy peat smoke makes its presence known, a dominant force that shapes the overall experience. That savory meatiness detected on the nose returns, manifesting as flavors of smoky brisket, salty bacon, and a hint of tangy barbecue sauce. A glimmer of sweetness emerges in the form of red fruits, like strawberry and cherry, a fleeting respite from the intensity. However, the ash and sea salt are the most assertive flavors, often masking the more traditional sherry notes that one might expect from this expression's finishing process. Despite being bottled at 48%, there's a surprising smoothness, with a minimal burn.

**üèÅ (Finish):** A medium-long finish that leaves a lasting impression, characterized by a noticeable astringency that tightens the mouth. The dominant notes are peat smoke and the lingering essence of a wood fire, creating a dry and smoky conclusion.

This single malt is a complex and challenging whisky, a dram that demands attention and contemplation. Its initial intensity was off-putting at first, but it revealed its charms gradually, growing on the palate with each sip. While the `$110` price tag might seem a bit steep, the overall experience was undeniably memorable. It's a whisky that would likely be appreciated by those who enjoy bold, smoky, and complex flavors, a dram that's perfect for a cold evening by the fire. It's not for the faint of heart, but for those who appreciate its unique profile, it's a whisky that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression. The value proposition may be slightly off, but the unique character and captivating experience, in my opinion, make it worth revisiting.
