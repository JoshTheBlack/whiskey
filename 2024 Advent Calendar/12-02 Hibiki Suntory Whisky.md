# Hibiki Suntory Whisky
## Japanese Harmony Blended Whisky
#### 43% ABV

👁: Very light .  Yellow, like peanut oil. Medium thin legs.

👃:  Pepper and mild oak.  Grape and apple.  Barley with shades of molasses and honeysuckle.

👅:  Bright and hot up front.  Buttery cream gives way to light citrus and tart apples.  Clove.  Leather.  Very mild oak.  It starts out strong and punchy, passes through sweet and ends with a nice acidic umami

🏁: The finish is strong and medium length.  More oak in the finish.  Maple syrup, vanilla, and lemon with lingering spice.  

Japanese blended whisky.  Some research turns up the malt whisky comes from Yamazaki and Hakushu distilleries, and the grain whisky from Chita.  
These are drawn from 5 different cask types, though I could only find details on three.
- American White Oak
- Sherry
- Mizunara Oak
The grain whisky makes up the largest component.  

Overall this is a nice, complex yet subdued pour.  There is a lot of subtlety and balance here.  Very demure.  Again, I think if this was bottled a little hotter than 43% ABV, it would benefit.  I would really like this to have a longer finish.  
The color really threw me off.  I did not expect to like this as much as I did.
The best price I've seen local to me is just north of `$100`.  I'd say the value proposition is there, but on the higher end.  If I ever find this under `$80`, I will definitely scoop up a bottle.
