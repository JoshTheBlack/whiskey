## Very Rare 2024 Vintage Release Irish Whisky
#### 40% ABV
üëÅ: A rich, deep copper. The whisky clings to the glass with thick, slow-moving legs that descend gracefully, hinting at a luxurious, full-bodied texture.

üëÉ: The nose is greeted with a harmonious blend of comforting aromas. Vanilla, crisp apple, and juicy pear form the foundation, intertwined with the warm spice of cinnamon and clove. A grounding note of oak provides a solid presence, while the freshness of cut grass and the sweetness of honey and molasses add further layers of complexity.

üëÖ: The whisky delivers on the promise of its appearance, enveloping the palate with an exceptionally smooth and velvety texture. Flavors of ripe peach, crisp apple, and sweet cream mingle with the golden sweetness of honey. A touch of ginger and clove adds a subtle, warming spice, creating a beautifully balanced and harmonious experience.

üèÅ: A medium finish unfolds, leaving a gentle memory on the palate. Notes of apple, pear, and oak linger, accompanied by a whisper of clove and a hint of pepper. The finish is remarkably muted, a testament to the whisky's refined and subdued character.

This is a truly fine Irish whisky, one that epitomizes smoothness and refinement. It's arguably one of the most seamless and gentle drams in this calendar, offering a mellow and exceptionally easy-drinking experience. If your preference leans towards a whisky that's subtle, refined, and incredibly smooth, then this bottle is an excellent choice. However, if you seek a more challenging or complex dram that pushes boundaries, this might not be the ideal selection. Its price point, near the top of the range in this calendar, positions it as a premium offering. It might draw comparisons to the smoothness of [[12-15 Johnny Walker Blue]] Label, but this Irish expression arguably surpasses it in overall quality, offering a more nuanced experience. While its smoothness is undeniable, it might be considered too subdued for some palates, particularly those who appreciate a more assertive character in their whisky. Nevertheless, it remains a high-quality, exceptionally smooth dram, albeit at a significant cost.
