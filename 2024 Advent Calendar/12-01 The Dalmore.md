# The Dalmore
## 18 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky, 2023 Edition
#### 43% ABV

👁:  Gold and copper, reddish hue around the glass.  Thin quick legs.

👃:  Sweet caramel and molasses.  Candied figs, orange marmalade.  Mild citrus.  Just a hint of oak.  A trailing scent of rum.

👅:  Smokey heat up front.  Pepper and aged oak.  Lots of dark fruits I can't quite identify.  Maybe fig, prune, raisin or date.  Blackberry.  

🏁: Medium finish.  Mild.  Sweet and oaky.  Blackberry lingers along with some floral notes.  

This is a high priced bottle.  Often `$300+`.  A lot of that is the name and the age.  
This is "nurtured by hand in American white oak ex-bourbon casks and 30 year old Matusalem Oloroso Sherry casks."  These Matusalem Oloroso casks are required to hodl sherry for at least 30 years.  

At 43% ABV, this could stand to be a bit stronger.  I think it would really benefit if it skirted a little closer to 50% ABV.  

This is a medium-low complex flavor profile, and the price is very high.  I don't think the value proposition is there for it.  

YMMV, but I don't see myself buying a bottle.
