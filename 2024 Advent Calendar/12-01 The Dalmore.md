# The Dalmore
## 18 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky, 2023 Edition
#### 43% ABV

üëÅ:  A radiant liquid gold with a captivating copper shimmer. A mesmerizing reddish hue dances around the edges as the liquid clings to the glass, forming thin, fleeting legs that quickly disappear.

üëÉ:  Aromas of rich caramel and decadent molasses entwine with the sweetness of candied figs and tangy orange marmalade. A subtle whisper of citrus adds a refreshing touch, while a hint of oak provides depth and complexity. A lingering scent of rum adds an intriguing, exotic twist.

üëÖ:  A gentle wave of smoky heat greets the palate, followed by a delightful dance of black pepper and aged oak. A medley of dark fruits emerges, hinting at luscious figs, plump prunes, sweet raisins, and chewy dates. A burst of juicy blackberry adds a vibrant, fruity dimension.

üèÅ: The finish is medium in length, leaving a mild yet satisfying warmth. Sweet notes of oak mingle with the lingering essence of blackberry, intertwined with delicate floral undertones.

This expression from The Dalmore carries a hefty price tag, often exceeding `$300`. While the allure of the brand and the 18 years of aging contribute to the cost, the value proposition seems questionable.

The whisky is "nurtured by hand" in a combination of American white oak ex-bourbon casks and 30-year-old Matusalem Oloroso Sherry casks. These exceptional sherry casks are required to hold sherry for at least 30 years, adding a unique dimension to the final product.

However, at 43% ABV, it feels somewhat restrained. A slightly higher proof, closer to 50% ABV, could potentially elevate the intensity and complexity of the flavors.

Overall, the flavor profile presents a medium-low complexity, which, coupled with the high price point, may not justify the investment for some. While personal preferences vary, the value may not align with the cost for many enthusiasts.  It likely won't be joining my shelf.
