#### 43% ABV
üëÅ: A captivating medium amber hue deepens into a rich gold at the edges, reminiscent of a treasured antique. Thin, nimble legs race down the glass, quickly disappearing.

üëÉ: A symphony of aromas unfolds, beginning with the boldness of charred oak and the primal allure of campfire smoke intertwined with a whisper of sea salt. Dried hay and earthy peat add a rustic charm, while sweet corn provides a contrasting sweetness. Warm cinnamon and zesty orange dance playfully, followed by the luxurious essence of leather and toasted almonds. A hint of pitch-dark chocolate adds a decadent touch.

üëÖ: The initial impression is a delightful harmony of sweet and smoky notes, reminiscent of candied bacon atop a warm smoked apple pie.

A whisper of orange and a touch of stone fruit emerge, adding complexity before transitioning into a pleasantly bitter and savory character, evoking memories of delectable barbecue.

üèÅ: The finish is somewhat light yet remarkably persistent, stretching out like a seemingly endless summer day. Zesty lemon and the aroma of burning fine tobacco mingle with the lingering essence of charred oak. The final act is a refreshing salty ocean breeze that lingers on the palate, leaving a lasting impression.

#### Notes
Nestled in the village of Lagavulin on the southern coast of Islay, Scotland, the Lagavulin distillery sits proudly between its equally renowned neighbors, Ardbeg and Laphroaig.

This 16-year-old expression is crafted using malted barley sourced from Port Ellen, the largest town on Islay, located a short six-minute drive from the distillery. The barley is carefully cultivated to ensure a specific flavor profile and consistent quality.

The water used in production comes from Lochan Sholum, a lake whose waters flow through peat bogs, imparting the characteristic peaty notes to the whisky.

Following traditional methods, the malt is meticulously crushed and ground before being combined with the peat-infused water from Lochan Sholum in a large mashtun. Yeast is then added to initiate the fermentation process.

The resulting wash undergoes a double distillation process in copper pot stills, the slowest on Islay, lasting over 14 hours. This meticulous approach contributes to the whisky's refined character.¬†

Finally, the spirit is matured for a minimum of 16 years in ex-bourbon American oak casks, followed by a finishing period in ex-sherry casks, adding further depth and complexity.
