# Lagavulin
## 16 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky
#### 43% ABV
👁: Medium amber darkening into gold at the edges.  Thin fast legs.

👃: Charred oak.  Strong campfire smoke and sea salt. Dried hay.  Peat. Sweet corn.  Cinnamon and orange.  Leather and toasted almonds.  Pitch dark chocolate.  Very complex and shifting.  Top tier nose.  

👅: Initially sweet and smokey, like a candied bacon on top of a smoked apple pie.  Brine.  Oily mouthfeel, peat charcoal receding into a salted caramel.  A hint of orange and some stonefruit that turns bitter and savory.  Reminiscent of good barbecue. 

🏁: Somewhat light, but longer than a summer day.  Lemon and burning fine tobacco, charred oak, ending with a salty ocean breeze that lingers forever.

This is top notch scotch.  Available at Total Wine for `$90` and worth every penny.  Very balanced and assertive.  Complex, full-bodied, and brimming with smoke.  A very smooth drink if you like a nice smokey single malt.  Highly recommended.

#### Notes
The Lagavulin distillery is located in Scotland in the village of Lagavulin in south Islay, directly between Ardbeg and Laphroaig.

Lagavulin 16-year single malt whisky is made with malted barley from the largest town in Islay, and a six-minute drive from the distillery, the nearby Port Ellen. The malt cultivated for Lagavulin is specially created to produce a specific flavor profile and consistent quality.

The water used to make Lagavulin comes from Lochan Sholum, with the lake water flowing down the hill through peat, helping to give the whisky its characteristic flavors. 

After the malt is crushed and ground with the distillery’s malt mill, the grist is combined with the water from Lochan Sholum and placed into a large mashtun. Yeast is added and fermentation takes place.

The wash goes through a double-distillation process—the slowest distillation on the isle of Islay—for over 14 hours in copper pot stills. 

This expression is aged in ex-bourbon American oak for a minimum of 16 years and finished in ex-sherry casks.
