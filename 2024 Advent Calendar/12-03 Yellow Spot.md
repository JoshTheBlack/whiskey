# Yellow Spot 
## 12 Year Old Single Pot Still Irish Whisky
#### 46% ABV

👁:  A captivating light amber hue shimmers with vibrant golden undertones, reminiscent of a radiant sunset. Thick, viscous legs cling to the glass, slowly and reluctantly receding, leaving behind a mesmerizing trail.

👃: Aromas of sweet young oak intertwine with the distinct essence of cutting board oil, creating an intriguing juxtaposition. Candied apples and creamy custard add a touch of indulgence, while a drizzle of honey enhances the sweetness. As the whisky breathes, a delightful transformation occurs, revealing a symphony of ripe pears and juicy peaches.

👅: The mouthfeel is both creamy and syrupy, coating the palate with a velvety texture. A burst of fruit flavors takes center stage, complemented by subtle nutty undertones. Hints of rich tobacco and malty sweetness add depth and complexity, while warm spices like nutmeg and cinnamon create a comforting warmth. A delicate hint of herbal tea adds an unexpected touch.

🏁: The finish is disappointingly dry and astringent. While a fleeting hint of fruit initially emerges, it is swiftly overwhelmed by a harsh, almost puckering astringency that lingers on the palate.

Priced at `$200` in my local market and `$150` at Total Wine, this pot still whiskey, similar to last year's Willett Pot Still Reserve Single Barrel, falls short of expectations. While not entirely offensive like the Rowans Creek Small Batch, it seems my palate does not fully appreciate the distinct flavor profile often associated with pot still whiskies.

The initial impression, with its alluring appearance and promising aromas, gives way to a less satisfying experience on the palate and finish. The dry, astringent finish, in particular, detracts from the overall enjoyment.

While some may find intrigue in the unique characteristics of this pot still offering, it ultimately fails to capture me.
