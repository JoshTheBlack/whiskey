# Yellow Spot 
## 12 Year Old Single Pot Still Irish Whisky
#### 46% ABV

👁:  Light and vibrant amber with golden undertones.  Thick, long legs.  Slow to recede.

👃: Sweet young oak, cutting board oil, candied apples, custard, honey.  Morphs into more fruit the longer I smell it.  Pears, peaches.

👅: Creamy and syrupy mouthfeel.  Fruit forward with nutty undertones.  Tobacco and malt.  Warm spices, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Herbal tea.

🏁: Dry and astringent.  Starts with a bit of fruit but is quickly overpowered with the harsh astringency.  

`$200` in my area, `$150` at Total Wine.  This, like last years [[12-21 Willets Pot Still Reserve Single Barrel]] is not my cup of tea.  I don't find it offensive, like I did the [[12-18 Rowans Creek Small Batch]], but I'm learning I just don't love the flavor profile of pot stills, I think.
