## 46 Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whisky
#### 47% ABV
üëÅ: A warm, tawny hue, like the color of fallen leaves in autumn. The whisky moves readily in the glass, forming thin, quick legs that race down the sides, suggesting a lighter body.

üëÉ: The nose is greeted with a pronounced oak presence, immediately followed by a sharp note of paint thinner, which quickly gives way to a sweeter profile of caramel and vanilla. Dark chocolate and hazelnut add a rich, nutty depth, while the comforting aroma of brown sugar provides a grounding sweetness.

üëÖ: The whisky coats the palate with an oily, viscous mouthfeel. Flavors of worn leather and aged oak provide a strong foundation, intertwined with the sweetness of vanilla and molasses. A distinct note of cherry cough syrup emerges, adding a medicinal, artificial cherry sweetness. Warming spices of cinnamon and clove provide a pleasant counterpoint. 

üèÅ: A medium finish unfolds, leaving a slightly astringent sensation. The cinnamon spice lingers, providing a gentle burn on the tongue and in the back of the throat. The cherry cough syrup note persists, accompanied by a whisper of oak, creating a somewhat medicinal aftertaste. 

This bourbon presents a decent value proposition at $36, offering a complex array of flavors for its price point. However, it faces stiff competition in this crowded segment. The artificial, sweetened cherry syrup note is a point of contention, and could be a deciding factor for many. If that particular profile appeals to you, then this could serve as a great daily drinker and a versatile mixer for cocktails. However, if you're sensitive to that artificial cherry note, it might detract from the overall experience. It's a decent bourbon for the price, but the prominent cherry cough syrup flavor prevents it from being a standout choice. It is ultimately up to personal preference, but that one element keeps this bottle from joining my shelf.
