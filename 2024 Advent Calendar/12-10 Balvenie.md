## 14 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky - The Week of Peat
#### 48.3% ABV
👁:  A delicate, pale gold, reminiscent of freshly baked shortbread. The whisky moves quickly in the glass, leaving behind thin, fleeting legs that suggest a lighter body.

👃:  An immediate and powerful wave of campfire smoke dominates the nose, enveloping the senses with the aroma of burning wood and a profound peatiness. It's a veritable bonfire in a glass, intense and all-encompassing, with an undercurrent of sea brine adding a salty, maritime dimension.

👅: The palate is greeted with the intense flavor of charred pecan wood, a smoky sweetness that's quickly followed by a surprising burst of sugar and a bright, zesty note of lemon. The ever-present peat and a subtle hint of malt weave their way through the other flavors. There is a distinct bitterness, akin to the inner shell membrane of a pecan. A touch of maple syrup sweetness provides a fleeting counterpoint, along with a savory, almost bacon-like note that adds a curious complexity.

🏁:  A long and lingering finish, dominated by a persistent bitterness. The memory of burnt marshmallows and chocolate orange, like a campfire s'more giving way to a lingering taste of fireplace ash or charcoal, a dry and intensely smoky conclusion.

This whisky is an unapologetically smoky experience, a powerful expression of peat and fire that will undoubtedly appeal to ardent smoke enthusiasts. However, for those who prefer a more balanced or nuanced profile, the overwhelming smokiness may prove to be too dominant. It's a dram that's perhaps lacking in complexity beneath the intense smokiness, a one-dimensional character that may not offer enough depth for some palates. This is a whisky for those who truly embrace the intense world of peat and smoke.
