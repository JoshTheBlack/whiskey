# SirDavis
## American Rye Whisky, Finished in Sherry Casks
#### 44% ABV
- **Mash Bill:** 51% rye and 49% barley (0% corn!)
- 👁: It pours a **deep orange**—looks good in the glass, with legs that run down pretty quick.

- 👃: I get a blast of **spicy rye** right away, backed up by sweet stuff like toffee, honey, and cinnamon, plus some orange and clove. Maybe a little chocolate hiding in there too.

- 👅: On the palate, I taste raisin, orange, ginger, and honey, with a nice smack of peppercorn and clove. Honestly, it's a **little thin** in the mouth.

- 🏁: The finish is **medium-long** and dries things out—it's **astringent**. I pick up floral notes, orange, and ginger, reminding me of "Angostura bitters," with gentle oak popping in right before it fades.

### The Verdict

This one is truly **unique** thanks to the lack of corn and the sherry cask finish. It's a decent first try, but let's be real: I think this would be a great **$40 bottle**. The celeb name doesn't make it worth the $89 MSRP; there are better options at that price point.

SirDavis was founded by Beyonce Knowles-Carter and named after her great-grandfather, Davis Hogue, a Prohibition-era moonshiner.  Aged in American oak and finished in sherry casks.
