# Westward Whiskey
## Single Malt Stout Cask Finish
#### 46% ABV
👁: A nice, deep amber and brown chestnut color. The legs are hanging on for a bit.

👃: I'm getting a good whiff of malted barley, honey, and some nuts—hazelnut and almond. There’s also a little banana and chocolate in there.

👅: It feels a little thin, but the flavor is big. It's hazelnut and those Whoppers malted milk balls, which is where that stout cask influence really shines. Vanilla, banana, and a light dusting of cinnamon show up too.

🏁: Pretty short finish. Mostly a chocolate stout flavor with that little bit of cinnamon spice at the end.

This one is made from **100% malted barley**. If you're a fan of chocolate stout and bourbon, this is definitely one you should try. They describe it as: **"Brewed like a craft ale, Distilled like a single malt, Aged like a bourbon,"** and I can see all of that playing a part here. It's not my typical jam, and I think it could use a little more proof, but I really enjoyed its unique, chocolatey vibe. I'd absolutely have another glass.
