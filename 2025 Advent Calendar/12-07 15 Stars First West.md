## First West Small Batch
#### 51% ABV
👁: It's a deep **chestnut** and **burnt umber** color with thin, quick legs.

👃: I'm getting **banana bread** and **caramel**, along with **cinnamon**, **vanilla**, **chocolate**, some **grape**, and **oak**.

👅: I taste **rye spice**, **peppercorn**, **apple**, **cherry**, and **toffee**. There's a light hint of **pipe tobacco** in there.

🏁: The finish is **long** and **warm**. The rye fades to **oak** and a hint of **char**.  Perhaps a bit on the dry side.

---

**My Take:** This one is right up my alley, it's **sweet and spicy**. This is a blend of bourbons aged **5-7 years**. It's got a fair amount of complexity. It's maybe a notch below the [[12-05 Oaklore Four Grain]] I had on Friday, but I'd happily grab a bottle.
