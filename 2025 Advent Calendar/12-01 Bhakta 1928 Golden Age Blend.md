- **🏁 Finish:** Long and smooth, feels **velvety**, and leaves a pleasant, buttery sweetness behind.

### **The Details**

This is a blend of **60% rye whiskey** (aged 5 years), **30% Calvados** (age unspecified), and **10% Armagnac**. The Armagnac is a blend of 1928, 1941, 1973, 1984, and 1996 vintages.

According to the folks who made it, **5% of the bottle is over 50 years old**, **30% is over 30 years old**, and the **average age is 15 years old**.

It was blended by **Raj Peter Bhakta** (of Whistle Pig fame) and is meant to be a **"celebration of the roaring twenties."**  Specifically: "With 1928, we set out to bottle the spirit of the Golden Age--when men dressed to fly and cocktails came with caviar.  This isn't just a drink; it's a time machine.  A celebration of beauty, bravery, and boundless ambition."

The MSRP of **$69** makes this a pretty good pour overall. The older spirits add a nice complexity, but the younger rye is noticeable. The labeling is a bit tricky, calling it **"straight rye whiskey"** then listing the **"calvados & armagnac"** right underneath. Still, it's recommended if you enjoy rye with a brandy twist.
