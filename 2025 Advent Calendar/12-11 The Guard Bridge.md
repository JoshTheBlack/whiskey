# The Guard Bridge
## Blended Malt Scotch Whisky
#### 46% ABV
- 👁️: **Light gold**, definitely reminds me of a Sauvignon Blanc. Thin, quick legs on the glass.
    
- 👃: Oddly, I got that **industrial funk** and **rubber tires** right away, but it smoothed out with **lemon curd**, **cornflakes**, and a touch of **sake**. The nose was interesting, but I personally found it uninviting.
    
- 👅: Much nicer than the nose. Tastes like **grass** and **lemongrass**, plus a bit of **pine** and **ginger spice**. Also noted **cornflakes**, **mellow oak**, **sherry**, **barley**, and **stone fruits**.
    
- 🏁: **Medium** length. Mostly **oak** and **gingerbread**, with a hint of **clove**.
    

> **Overall:** A decent, light blended malt with some nice complexity.
