# Two Stacks
## The First Cut Signature Blend
#### 43% ABV
👁: Pale gold.  Thick legs

👁: I see a beautiful **pale gold** color, and when I swirl it, there are some **thick legs** running down the glass.

👃: I get a nice, light layer of **peat smoke**, which is welcoming. Beyond that, it smells rich with **butter** and **brown sugar**, a note of **tea**, and a slightly strange hint of **melted plastic** that's kind of intriguing.

👅: The taste is lively! I'm getting an immediate hit of **ginger**, **black pepper**, and a little **salt**. It quickly mellows into sweetness with **honey**, **butterscotch**, and **almonds**, plus some fruit like **candied pear** and a touch of **pineapple**. Darker notes of **coffee** and **soot** help balance it out.

🏁: The finish is **very long**, which is great. That light **peat smoke** stays with me the whole time, along with warm **spices**, that bright **pineapple**, and a little **vanilla**.

This Irish whiskey is a blend.  It uses **40% Dark Grain** from Virgin American Oak casks, **40% Light Grain** from Kentucky Bourbon casks, **8% Pot Still** from Oloroso sherry butts, **10% Double-distilled Malt** from Kentucky Bourbon casks, and **2% Peated Malt** also from Kentucky Bourbon casks.

To be honest, **Irish whiskey is not my jam and I have disliked most of the pot still's I've tried.** I found this one to be **quite nice**. At an **MSRP around $35**, I think it’s **a step above pretty much any Irish whiskey I've tried**. I just wish it wasn't so hard to find near me.
