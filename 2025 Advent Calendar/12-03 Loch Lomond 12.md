# Loch Lomond
## 12 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky
#### 46% ABV
👁: Like coppery apple-juice, with medium quick legs

👃: Oak, apple, and lemon. A little bit of an old library ancient books. Salty, with smoldering oak and a faint cinnamon/fig note. A surprising afterthought of rubber.

👅: Smoky peat and a noticeable industrial grease flavor right away. It has an oily mouthfeel. Clove, peppercorn, caramel, charred sugar, and malt. A touch musty with a bitter, ashy taste.

🏁: Medium length. Starts with peat smoke and oak, then fades into cinnamon and pepper. The oiliness goes away completely, leaving a little dry, grassy hint at the end.

This one will cost you about **$40**. Not a bad drink for the price, though it offers a little less than the "[[12-18 Loch Lomond]] 14 year." Give it a try if you want a decent Scotch that provides "a hint of that industrial funk" without being too much.
