## Tequila Barrel Finished Bourbon
#### 46.5 ABV
👁: A nice mix of copper and chestnut with medium legs.

👃: Lots of oak and anise up front, followed by a citrus mix of orange peel, lemon zest, and grapefruit. There is definitely a whisper of agave hanging around.

👅: Feels a little on the leaner side. You get honey, lemon, and grapefruit mixed with tobacco and savory spices like clove, nutmeg, and black pepper. There are some herbal notes and oak, plus that specific agave sweetness.

🏁: Short and sweet. The agave and orange citrus shine here, fading out with licorice and baking spice.

**The Specs** 
- **Price:** $75 
- **Mashbill:** 70% corn, 25% malted rye, 5% malted barley 
- **Aging:** 3 years in new charred American oak, then finished for 1 year in Reposado tequila barrels (which were graduated from sherry casks).

**Overall:** This is a tad brighter than I expected. I'm not usually big on tequila, and while the influence on this dram is subtle, it is noticeable—especially that hint of agave. It's not bad at all, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out.
