## Four Grain Bourbon Whiskey
#### 46% ABV
- **👁 Look:** Pecan shell brown with some copper flashing. Those legs are thick and slow.
- **👃 Nose:** Sweet stuff. Think **honeyed pecan**, yellow cake, toffee, butterscotch, and a nice hint of oak.
- **👅 Palate:** Right away, it brings the spice with **rye** and **peppercorn**. It's got a thin, creamy feel. You get a little cherry/raisin hitting against the butterscotch, followed by hot cinnamon candy.
- **🏁 Finish:** That **rye spice** hangs on for a long time, slowly fading out with vanilla, leather, and oak.

> **Mashbill:** 72% Corn, 11% Wheat, 10% Rye, 7% Malted Barley

> This is a **nice complex bourbon** that's quite top-notch. The spice from the rye balances out the sweeter nose really well.  I'll be searching for a bottle next time I'm in Charlotte.

> **Price:** Available at **$69.95** from the distiller's website.
