# Frey Ranch
## Bottled-in-Bond Straight Rye Whiskey
#### 50% ABV
👁: Light copper, kinda like apple juice. **Quick, thin legs** on the glass.

👃: Sweet notes of **honey** and **butterscotch**, then a bit of spice with **ginger** and **black pepper**. I also get **fig newton cookie** and **oak**. Just a faint bit of **almond** and **char**.

👅: Hit with **black pepper** and **lemon** right up front. The mouthfeel is **thick and syrupy**. Definitely more **oak** and **char**. There's some **allspice** and a surprising, almost **grassy/herbal** note like **celery and parsley**. Very **rye forward**. It **drinks hot**, making it feel like it's higher proof than it is.

🏁: **Long and luxurious**. It's spicy with **cardamom** and **white pepper**, which then fades into a pleasant **vanilla pudding**. It leaves a **sticky, tingling** feeling that makes you want more.

**Notes:**

This one is **a lot less minty and dill-flavored** than many ryes. The **initial heat** on the sip is real, but the **finish is great** and keeps you coming back. Overall, it's **balanced and complex**. **Top notch** despite the initial burn.
