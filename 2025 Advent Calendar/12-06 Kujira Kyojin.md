# Kujira Okinawa Japanese Whisky
## Kujira Kyojin
#### 40% ABV

- 👁 **Look:** Honey and marigold with thick, slow-moving legs.
- 👃 **Nose:** A soft mix of almond, rose, and sweet white chocolate. You definitely get the oak coming through, alongside a distinct sake note.
- 👅 **Palate:** The chocolate turns darker here. There’s a clear sake influence, joined by fruity mango and rose. Just a slight whisper of oak in the background.
- 🏁 **Finish:** A bit short and astringent. It leaves you with a rich dark chocolate taste and a snap of young white oak.

>**Specs:** Distilled from 100% Indica rice and aged for three years in American white oak barrels.

> **The Verdict:** These rice-based expressions aren't typically my cup of tea, but if that style is up your alley, this offers a nice, delicate, and complex profile worth trying.
