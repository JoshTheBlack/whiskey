# Chicken Cock
## Small Batch Bourbon
#### 50% ABV
- 👁: Deep amber color with thick, slow-moving legs.
- 👃: Sweet butterscotch and a little bright **lemon zest**. You've also got that classic barrel hit of **oak** and some spice—white pepper and old **tanned leather**.
-  👅: A nice mix of spice, mainly **white pepper** and **ginger**, alongside sweet dried **apricot** and **honey**. It has a **creamy, light mouthfeel**, but this is where it falls a little flat for me.
- 🏁: **Short** and sweet, mostly just that **white pepper and honey** fading out.

**Pertinent Info:**
